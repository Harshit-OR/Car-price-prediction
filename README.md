Objective of this project is to predict the price of a car using machine learning techniques, based on various features like engine size, mileage, year of manufacture, and other car specifications. The project involves several key steps:

1. Data Collection:
The dataset used (Cardetails.csv) contains various attributes of cars such as:
Brand/Model, Year, Kilometers Driven, Fuel Type, Transmission Type, Owner Type, Mileage, Engine, Power, Price

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handled missing values (e.g., dropped or imputed them).
Converted categorical features like Fuel Type, Transmission, and Owner into numerical format using encoding (e.g., One-Hot Encoding).
Removed outliers or inconsistencies in numerical features (like extremely high or low mileage or price).
Standardized or normalized numerical data if needed.

3. Feature Selection:
Selected important input variables (independent variables) that influence price the most:
Year of manufacture, Kilometers driven, Engine power, Mileage, Fuel type, Transmission, etc.

4. Model Building:
Used Multiple Linear Regression to model the relationship between features and car price.
Split the data into training and testing sets to validate model performance.

5. Model Evaluation:
Predicted car prices on the test dataset.
Measured model performance using the R² score, which indicates how well the model explains the variance in the price.
R² close to 1 means better accuracy.
Optionally, other metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) or RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) may be used.

6. Insights:
Identified which features most influence car prices.
Found that newer cars, low kilometers driven, and higher engine power generally lead to higher prices.

Fuel type and transmission also impact car value.

7. Conclusion
This project helps understand how various factors impact car pricing. It can be used by car dealerships, resale platforms, or individual buyers to estimate the fair price of a car based on its characteristics.
